Hello!

This email contains your voucher code(s) for registration to
{{batch.conference}}.

To use these vouchers, a registration has to be made the
same way as with a paid registration. This means that each
attendee must make his/her own registration, and fill in all
the details. This *must* be done individually for each attendee,
as this registration is also used to get access to information
during the event, as well as pre-conference emails.

At the bottom of the registration form, there is a field named
"Voucher code". Enter the code from below into that field,
and then click "Save and finish registration" (when all other
details are completed). If no additional items at cost have
been added, that will result in a total cost of zero, and once
that is confirmed, the registration will complete automatically.

The vouchers are valid for registration of type:
{{batch.regtype.regtype}}

It will not be possible to use them for a different kind of
registration. However, paid additional options (if any are
available for this conference) can still be added, but will
have to be paid for separately.

Each voucher code can only be used *once*.

Your voucher code(s) are (one on each line, and no spaces in
the codes - in case your mail program has reformatted the lines):

{%for v in vouchers%}{{v.vouchervalue}}
{%endfor%}

The registration form is available at:
{{SITEBASE}}/events/register/{{batch.conference.urlname}}/

If you have a PostgreSQL community account, you can view the
current usage of your vouchers at:
